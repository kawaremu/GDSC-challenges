    <p>
      When you join a Google Developer Group, you'll have the opportunity to learn new skills in a variety of formats. 
      You'll also meet local developers virtually or in person with similar interests in technology. The community prides 
      itself on being an inclusive environment where everyone and anyone interested in tech—from beginner developers to 
      experienced professionals—all are welcome to join.
      As a Women Techmakers Ambassador and Google Developer Group lead in Floripa, Brazil, Lorena worked with the local 
      community to create a week of special events, including over 12 talks and sessions centered on empowering the 
      LGBTQIA+ experience in tech.We strive to make Android development content accessible to all so that anyone can become 
      an Android developer. Over the years, millions of students at all different levels have consumed our learning content 
      and worked through courses and codelabs to advance their skills. We continue to update and release new content as the 
      ever-changing industry continues to evolve.As we continue to explore how different Google Developer Groups build their 
      communities, we interviewed Hebe He, an organizer of Google Developer Group Guangzhou in China. Learn more about how she 
      is building the developer scene in China, thinking up new events for her community.
